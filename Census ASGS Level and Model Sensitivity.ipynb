    "The goal of this workbook is to compare the efficacy of machine learning models based on different levels of spacial consolidation, based on the [Australian Statistical Geography Standard](https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Australian+Statistical+Geography+Standard+(ASGS)) framework. the key questions are:   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we find a model for predicting with an R2 value > 0.7? (Based on [prior work](https://github.com/blkemp/ABS-Region-Data/tree/BKSubmission), I suspect the answer is yes).\n",
    "- Using this model, what is the impact on accuracy for feeding in data that is consolidated at a different level (e.g. neighborhood vs city vs county)?\n",
    "- How do models trained at differing levels of granularity compare in both baseline accuracy and generalisability? I.e. Are models trained with the most fine grained data more accurate, or are they prone to overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point I will be utilising the [Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016 Census Datapacks](https://datapacks.censusdata.abs.gov.au/datapacks/) and attempting to predict \"working from home\" behaviours by region. Why this particular response vector? a) It just seems interesting and b) I suspect that demographic information available within the census itself (gender, age, profession and industry) will all be strongly related to both individuals' propensity to undertake working from home and their ability to do so with support from employers."

    "- **Age** - I suspect there is a certain trend within particular generations to work from home, as well as a stage-of-career factor that often ties to a person's age that could be reflected. \n",
    "- **Income** - Higher skillsets have greater remuneration and flexibility to work from home.\n",
    "- **Occupation** - Particular industries have the ability to work from home (software development) wheras others do not (car maintenance).\n",
    "- **Family Composition** - I'm actually interested to see what this shows. Are parents more likely to work from home or people who are single?\n",
    "- **Internet status** - I'd expect the ability to work from home is contingent on having internet access.   \n",
    "\n",
    "I may choose to add in a few more tenuous links such as:\n",
    "- **Building occupation status** - Are home owners or renters more likely to WFH?\n",
    "- **Family with children type** - Further insight into how are parents more likely to work from home, does age of child have an influence (pre-school vs at school)?\n",
    "- **Number of Bedrooms** - Are bigger houses more or less likely to entice someone to WFH?\n",
    "- **Place of Birth** - Are there trends in birthplace that indicate WFH status? Cultural factors or simple immigrant vs non.\n",
    "- **Country of Birth of Parents** - Potential influence on propentsity to WFH based on household cultural factors.\n",

    "Pretty interesting that there is a strong trend for significantly senior managers (those over the typical retirement age) to have a strong correlation with working from home participation. Unsurprisingly there are negative correlations with machinery operators and low income earners. It also kind of surprises me that there is a negative correlation with parents of young children. For some reason I expected they would be more likely to push for working from home arrangements to allow them flexibility in home management during an intense period of child rearing."

    "### Observations on SA2 level data\n",
    "So at a quick look, the R2 score has dropped dramatically and thus so has the utility of the model. The model seems pretty bad at predicting a few of the cases where the actual recorded work from home data has a rate of 0. I may try a case where I exclude any zero values from the dataset itself and see what impact that has. My other main impression is that the drop off in accuracy seems intuitive to me, because making more granular predictions is simply more difficult, even with more granular data (e.g. what is the weather going to be at 10-11am vs what is the weather going to be for the day).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I am keen to get a hierarchy of Statistical Areas, to see if predictions at the SA2 level which are then aggregated at the SA3 level end up better or worse than models trained at the SA3 level in the first instance. As noted [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1270.0.55.001~July%202016~Main%20Features~Statistical%20Area%20Level%202%20(SA2)~10014), Statistical area codes are hierarchical, so it should be fairly straightforward to make predictions at the SA2 level, then aggregate by the first 5 characters in the index column to get to a prediction at the SA3 level.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first I would like to simply look at what happens if i make predictions at the SA2 level based on the SA3 model, and vice versa. However I can't because for some reason the training features are different (more at SA3 level). Perhaps at a SA2 level a lot of items are zero'd out out of privacy concerns?"

    "From the above, the use of SA2 level data was pretty poor at predicting, so as a final output, what happens if we simply assign the work from home participation rate to any SA2 level region to be that of the SA3 region predicted by the much more robust trained SA3 model? E.g. if the SA2 level region is 115039941 then return the prediction for the SA3 region 11503 using the SA3 trained model. Because this is simply prediction participation rates rather than absolute values, the model should be able to handle this fairly well.\n",
