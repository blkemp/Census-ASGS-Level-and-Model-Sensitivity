    "As support for the main workbook, I first need an effective way of selecting which categories to select in the first instance from the extremely large datasets. From the raw metadata file for the 2016 datapack, there was 15536 different data points for each statistical area across all 59 tables. Some of these were totals of other lines, some were the total population, some had combinations of classifications available elsewhere in the overall population, etc. so a mechanism of refinement is clearly necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally I would like to be able to import data based on some simple aggregations where possible (e.g. by sex), or otherwise taking the \"highest\" level data possible given the input constraints. E.g. I would like to say \"Import data from tables G09, G52 and G53, but split by sex where possible\", if \"sex\" is not available in one of the tables, it will still return the data from the table, but from the most aggregated column(s) only. Additionally, if \"Sex\" is only available as a sub-category of another split (e.g. the measure is \"Sex by Age\") I would like to be able to perform my own aggregation, to abstract away the unneccessary other details imbedded in the data (e.g. sum all the \"Age\" categories together, grouping by sex)."

    "I noticed that very conveniently a lot of the capitalisation in the \"Long\" field works as a delimiter between different population characteristics. Working through some exceptions below, split the Long fields based on capitalisation (and a couple of other hueristics) to get down to a much shorter list of 911 characteristics. I turned this information into a csv file which I then did some tedious review on in order to come up with a much shorter list of 61 categories and created a new \"Meta\" file which I import after this section."
